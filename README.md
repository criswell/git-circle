# git-circle

`git-circle` is a git extension which provides CLI interaction with
your builds on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

This is currently *very* much a work in progress. You can download it, and use
it, but it's in flux and will change quite a bit in the coming days or weeks.

Stay tuned.
